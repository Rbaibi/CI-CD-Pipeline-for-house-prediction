[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/Rbaibi/CI-CD-Pipeline-for-house-prediction/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Rbaibi/CI-CD-Pipeline-for-house-prediction/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml)

Shell Project 6: CI/CD Pipeline for house price prediction

## Project Plan

* A link to a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/iabbTYwG/ci-cd-flask-azure-web-app) for the project
* A link to a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYg9aeNhqRpSTXk2ArI2On4Emg_dwG5LRVx6bBLDWrE/edit?usp=sharing) that includes the original and final project plan

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell. 

The output should look similar to this:
